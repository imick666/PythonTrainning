# While loop

The "while" loop is used to execute the same code until a condition is met.

## Interact whith the loop
- **break** : Stop the loop
- **continue** : restart the loop from the beginning

```python
while { condition }:
    if { another_condition }:
        break # Stop the loop
    else :
        continue # Restart the loop

    # Make something

# Make something after the loop ended
```
